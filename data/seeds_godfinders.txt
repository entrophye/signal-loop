They said the divine would sing; we found only a frequency that hurts to 
hear.
 Eclipsera's soil remembers footsteps that never existed.
 The Pulse is not a beat; it is a hunger counting backwards.
 We opened the hatch and the air wrote something inside our lungs.

God is not gone. He's buried.
 The planet speaks in subtraction.
 The choir is a machine misfiring a prayer.
 If we are found, do not unearth us.
 We mapped a light that refuses coordinates.
 Our bones learned a new alphabet.
