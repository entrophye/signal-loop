We came to Eclipsera to measure the silence; the silence measured us back.
If you hear the Pulse, do not count with it; it counts you.
We carved a cross on the dust and the dust carved back.
Report says light is safe; the light disagrees.
No one dies here; they are translated.
The soil keeps a library of footsteps that never existed.
We brought a faith; we found a mouth.
God is not gone. He's buried.
